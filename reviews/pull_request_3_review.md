### Summary
The README.md contains mixed and unrelated content (editor settings, rpm install commands, and a commented profile template). Please clean the file by moving editor settings to .vscode/settings.json, placing installation commands under an Installation section with context, and adding essential sections: Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, License.

### Line Comments
1. **Line 1:** The title is fine but should include a one-line description of the project's purpose.
2. **Lines 3-15:** This commented block looks like a GitHub profile README template. If not used here, remove or replace it with project-specific content.
3. **Lines 16-22:** These appear to be editor JSON settings. Move them to .vscode/settings.json or remove them from README.
4. **Lines 23-24:** The rpm/VSCode repository setup commands lack context. Add an Installation section explaining why and when to run these commands, and include required versions.
5. **General:** The README is missing key sections: Installation, Usage, Contributing, License. Please add them or link to separate files (CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE).
6. **General:** Consider adding status badges (CI, license) at the top of the README.
